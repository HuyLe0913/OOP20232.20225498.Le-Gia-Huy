1 . advantages of polymophism :

You can reuse your code for different type of object
Moreover, it enable overriding, which mean you can change the behaviour for each individual classes
It make your code easier to extend by using method that can fit to many object of different classes.

2. Inheritance enable polymophism

When a class is inherited from a super class, it inherits the method and field of the super class, but you can override the method in the subclass so it can fit to this class, this is a form of polymophism.
Its allow you to achieve polymophism by treating different objects uniformly through their common superclass.

3. Difference between inheritance and polymophism

Poly :

- the ability of objects to take on multiple forms (overloading,overriding,...)

Inheritance :

- is the mechanism that a class (subclass) inherits properties and behaviours from another class (super class)
- help to reuse code efficiently and hierarchy structure
- only get by using extends keyword
